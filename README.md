#  Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other clinical parameters.  
It demonstrates the **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** ‚Äî from data preprocessing to model evaluation and optimization.
